From Brendan Fraser to Michelle Yeoh, who identifies as Asian when others before her couldn't, to Ruth Carter and Ke Huy Quan, here are some highlights:  - Navalny won the Oscar for “Best Documentary,” certainly upsetting all the Putin fans.  - Ruth Carter became the second black woman in history to win the “best costume design” award, as well as the first black woman ever to win two #Oscars  - Michelle Yeoh became the first person who identifies as Asian to win the Best Actress award. Despite the right wing melting down, the phrase was used because Merle Oberon was nominated for an Oscar in 1936 and hid her South Asian ancestry to be accepted.  - Ke Huy Quan A former refugee and immigrant to the US won an Oscar after decades away from Hollywood.  - A feel-good photo was taken where the cast of 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' invited Brendan Fraser into their photo.
